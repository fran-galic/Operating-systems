# Operating Systems - Laboratory Exercises

This repository contains all laboratory exercises for the "Operating Systems" course, designed to provide hands-on experience with key operating system concepts. The repository includes all the lab assignments from the course, covering various aspects of operating systems such as multithreading, process management, memory allocation, and file systems.

## Course Overview:

The operating system is a collection of programs that act as intermediaries between hardware, application software, and users. The primary goal of this course is to develop an understanding that operating systems serve two main purposes:

1. **To allocate computer resources efficiently**, ensuring optimal utilization.
2. **To establish an appropriate environment** for program development and execution.

## Laboratory Exercises:

Each lab focuses on practical implementations of core operating system principles. Topics include:

- **Multithreading**: Writing programs that create and manage multiple threads.
- **Process Management**: Understanding the creation and management of processes.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Applying tools like semaphores and mutexes to handle concurrency.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Demonstrating how subsystems handle interrupts.
- **Memory Management**: Using memory allocation functions and understanding paging on demand.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Analyzing and implementing scheduling strategies.
- **File Systems**: Developing basic file system functions.

## Learning Outcomes:

By completing these laboratory exercises, I have learned to:

- Write multithreaded programs and create programs that spawn multiple processes.
- Demonstrate the functionality of interrupt-handling subsystems.
- Apply synchronization mechanisms in practice.
- Identify and explain the components of the operating system kernel.
- Analyze the behavior of deterministic and non-deterministic task systems.
- List and explain scheduling algorithms.
- Use memory allocation functions.
- Explain paging-based memory allocation on demand.
- Develop custom file system functions.
